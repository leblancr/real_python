Manual Activation: Use source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
when you need explicit control over the activation process or when working in 
scripts that require direct interaction with the virtual environment.

Streamlined Activation: Use eval $(poetry env activate) for a quicker, 
one-liner activation, suitable for interactive sessions where you want to enter 
the virtual environment with minimal effort.
